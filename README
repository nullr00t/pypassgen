pypassgen - A completely random pronounceable passphrase generator with many options!
Created 2018-11-25 By Justin Ball

I was inspired to create this small project by macOS's password generator in the keyring access application.
I wanted somewhat of a clone that I can run on any compatible system, so I chose python for its flexibility.
To come in the future is improved coding and definition types, as well as the specification of how long
you want your password to be in total amount of characters.
